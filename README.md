# Javascript Days of Code Streak - Day1
Hello Guys! Recently I am working on JavaScript and some of its projects for my 20 Days JS Code Streak.
So my first project for this code streak is Magic 8 Ball. It is basically a game in which JavaScript Code is implemented so that player can grab the 8 ball, ask it a question, shake it, and have the 8 ball respond with a somewhat enigmatic, somewhat applicable answer.
Stay tuned as more projects related to JavaScript(major) are going to be uploaded!!!
